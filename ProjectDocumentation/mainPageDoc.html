    <h1>My Journey to creating the main page</h1>
    <p>As with most things I do I started with a goal in mind and then tried to do each one</p>
    <p>The goals for the page were as follows</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a Navigation Bar that can be used on all pages</li>
        <li>Create a Page that looks good</li>
        <li>Create multiple themes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I had some prior knowledge of HTML from reading some of the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools HTML tutorial</a></p>
    <p>and a pathetic amount of CSS experience working on my <a href="https://604robotics.com">old robotics team's website</a> (wordpress sucks btw).</p>
    <p>but beyond that I had no idea about most website design. I started by looking at tutorials (I tell myself that I prefer text-based as opposed to)</p>
    <p>video based but I think they are much less efficient). I stumbled upon <a href=" https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-simple-website/">this</a></p>
    <p>which was pretty helpful for setting up most of it. </p>
